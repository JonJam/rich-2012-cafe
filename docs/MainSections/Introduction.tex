\section{Introduction}

OptiCaff is the new innovative way to maximise your productivity during university hours! By analysing your caffeine content in addition to your weekly timetable, OptiCaff can work out the optimum time for your next caffeine consumption. However, this is not all it can do. Not only will it notify you when its time for you to consume your next caffeinated beverage, it will tell you what type will be most effective (tea, coffee, energy drinks) and then point you to the nearest place on campus that sells that product.
