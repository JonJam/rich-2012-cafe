\subsection{Coffee / Caffeine Research}


Given the vast range of different cafffeinated products and the limited time to produce a prototype application, it was decided that the products displayed by OptiCaff would be grouped into four different types of drink, and each type would be allocated an average caffeine content. Below is a table showing these totals, which were got from these sources \cite{Coke} \cite{TeaCoffee} \cite{EnergyDrink}.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Drink Category} & \textbf{Average Caffeine Content (mg)} \\\hline
Tea & 40 \\\hline
Coffee & 54 \\\hline
Energy Drinks & 80 \\\hline
Soft Drinks & 34.5 \\\hline
\end{tabular}
