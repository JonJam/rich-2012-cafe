\section{Project Conceptualisation \& Monetisation}

This section details an outline of the ideas that were conceived and the justifications for the final idea coupled with its monetisation potential. 

\subsection{Acceptance Criteria}
It was decided from the early stages that the application would use the University of Southamptons open linked data (see section \ref{sec:Data} relating to its internal organisations). The focus of this data would be the points of service (e.g cafes, vending machines) that sold caffeine in and around the University. After establishing the data sets a number of ideas of how to best uitlise this data were brought to the forefront. In order to establish the most valuable idea, each potential solution was weighed against certain aspects: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{Uniqueness Factor:} Was it a new novel idea and if so how?}
	\item{\textbf{Monetisation Potential:} Was there the potential to make money out of it?}
	\item{\textbf{User Interest:} Would it capture users on a long term basis as opposed to just on a novelty?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ideas}
The three ideas that were contemplated are listed below, and Table 1 details their weighting against the acceptance criteria:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{Caffeine Finder:} Allows user to find the nearest available caffeine to them at any given time.}
	\item{\textbf{Caffeine Notify:} Buzzes and notifies the user when they pass caffeine.}
	\item{\textbf{OptiCaff:} Tracks user caffeine levels, and suggests and locates caffeine vendors at an appropriate time for the next dosage taking into account their schedule. Encorporates a leaderboard for users to compete with one another over maintaining optimum caffeine levels.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Final Choice - OptiCaff}
OptiCaff was chosen as the final idea as it fulfilled all three of the criterion listed above, and fulfilled all of them in a superior fashion. It has the unique factor not through its individual ideas but through the combination of these into a multifunctional app that not only allows you to monitor your caffeine consumption, but to locate places that sell caffeine and tie the two together to optimise your caffeine intake. In addition to this it has the competative element which aids in capturing and retaining user interest as well as boosting potential monetisation potential.
