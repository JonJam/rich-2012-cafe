\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Product Evaluation}
Four out of the five goals set in the initial planning stages were achieved, and one of them was partially achieved. Table \ref{tab:Requirements} details this. 

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Table Evaluating Requirements}
\label{tab:Requirements}
\begin{tabular}{|p{20pt}|p{140pt}|p{40pt}|p{214pt}|}
\hline
	\textbf{No.} 
	& \textbf{Requirement} 													
	& \textbf{Met} 	
	& \textbf{Description} 
\\\hline
	1		
	& Obtain and use linked data detailing caffeine sources within the University of Southampton.					
	& Yes		
	& All points of service that are listed as providing caffeine are used within our system. 
\\\hline
	2 		
	& Integrate the user's schedule									
	& Partially	
	& As discussed earlier in section \ref{sec:calendar} accessing the timetable data from SUSSED wasn't a simple 
	task so Google Calendar was used instead. This means that the users have to input their own timetable data, 
	however it meets the requirement of using calendar data. 
\\\hline
	3 		
	& Monitor users caffeine intake and predict the optimum time for their next consumption.		
	& Yes		
	& Opticaff works out the caffeine decay rate (based on the calculations specified in section \ref{sec:caffeine}) 
	and based on the users timetabled events makes a prediction for the best time to consume the next caffeinated 
	beverage. 	
\\\hline
	4 		
	& Provide a leaderboard to rank users based on how well they maintain their caffeine level within the optimum 
	range during their scheduled events.	
	& Yes		
	& A basic leaderboard has been implemented that ranks users based on their caffeine consumption. 
\\\hline
	5 		
	& Approximate the users position and locate the closest appropriate caffeine sources to them.				
	& Yes		
	& The positional values of all the caffeine points of service are stored by OptiCaff. By using GPS the users 
	location can be determined also and then they can be directed to the appropriate destination. 
\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This shows that OptiCaff was very successful in meeting its necessary aims.

\subsection{Team Evaluation}
The group feel that they worked well together as a team. Everyone participated and fulfilled at least the two roles they were assigned at the beginning of the project. The bi-weekly meetings were regularly attended to with additional sessions when necessary. The project met its requirements and was delivered on time for the deadline.
